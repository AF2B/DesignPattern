## Introduction

Behavioral design patterns are concerned with algorithms and the assignment of responsibilities between objects. They describe not just the patterns of objects or classes but also the patterns of communication between them. These patterns help in defining the communication between objects in a way that is flexible and extendable.

## Behavioral Design Patterns

Behavioral design patterns are those patterns that deal with how objects interact and communicate with each other. Examples of behavioral patterns include but are not limited to:

- Chain of Responsibility
- Command
- Interpreter
- Iterator
- Mediator
- Memento
- Observer
- State
- Strategy
- Template Method
- Visitor

Each pattern addresses different issues related to the behavior of objects and their interactions, providing various techniques to manage and organize responsibilities and communication.
